# TwoSum Algorithm

Given an array of integers 'nums' and an integer 'target', this algorithm written in JavaScript returns indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

Remember: You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Usage

Call the 'twoSum' function and pass to it 2 arguments: The array of numbers to analyze and the target number.

```javascript
twoSum(nums, 9);
```

## Algorithm Time Complexity

```bash
O(n)
```
