# TwoSum Algorithm

Given an array of integers 'nums' and an integer 'target', this algorithm written in JavaScript returns the indexes of the two numbers that added together result in the target number.

Remember: You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Usage

Call the 'twoSum' function and pass to it 2 arguments: The array of numbers to analyze and the target number.

```javascript
twoSum(nums, target);
```

## Algorithm Time Complexity

```bash
O(n)
```
